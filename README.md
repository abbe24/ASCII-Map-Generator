# ASCII-Map-Generator
Real elevation data for Logan, UT was pulled to generate different elevation maps for the area using Python. Different elevation maps centered on Utah State University's Old Main Building (designated with an "@" symbol) were created. An html file is used to display the map in browser. Instructions for creating a server and displaying ascii_map.txt in browser is given on the first line of index.html: to run make a terminal by selecting new terminal, run: "python -m http.server 8000" and paste url: "http://localhost:8000/index.html". 

The purpose of the project was to experiment with different methods for creating ascii maps, with the idea to create an ascii role-playing game down the road with such maps.

ascii_elevation.txt is an ascii elevation map generated from try_elevation.py and centered on Utah State University's Old Main Building. Each number represents the highest elevation of the tile rounded to the nearest thousand and divided by 1000.

ascii_elevation_browser.png is a screenshot of the webpage generated by the html file that displays ascii_elevation.txt.

ascii_map.txt is an ascii elevation map generated from try_elevation.py and centered on Utah State University's Old Main Building. The different ascii symbols represent the gradient of the terrain or the elevation gain between the lowest and highest points of the tile.
